**On-chain VAT Refund Payment Protocol Infrastructure** protecting users against time loss, missed claims in fear of missing flights, and payment failures, powered by **Monad blockchain (EVM-compatible)**.

**Simply means "Helping users to claim VAT Refund Anytime Anywhere without hassling"**

> **Note:** This project was originally built on Aptos blockchain and is currently transitioning to Monad (EVM-compatible). Legacy Aptos code remains in the codebase but is not actively used. MetaMask is used for wallet integration instead of Petra Wallet.

## 💡 Story / Inspiration

**The Problem That Started It All:**
- Travelled to Dubai, bought MAC and BALMAIN clothes worth 1000 AED VAT claim
- Reached DXB airport cutting it close due to Dubai Burj Khalifa traffic  
- Saw a long queue at VAT refund counter, decided to wait - line wasn't moving
- **Result: Missed flight, lost 5000 AED flight ticket = Net Loss 6000 Dirhams**

This isn't just my problem - **it's a global crisis.**

### 📊 The Global Problem
**$200 Billion in VAT Goes Unclaimed Annually** due to:
- Long queues at VAT refund counters (Dubai, Planet, etc.)
- Fear of missing flights
- Forgotten claims or lost receipts  
- Average refund processing time: **10+ days**
- Complex paperwork and bureaucratic delays

These delays cause inconvenience, financial losses, and system failures worldwide.

## 🚀 The Solution: ⚡ Orbix

**Helping Masses to:**
- ✅ Claim VAT Refund fully on-chain **anytime, anywhere**
- ✅ **Super Simple, Super Efficient, Super Easy** process
- ✅ **Non-Intrusive**: No additional parameters, code, or complex application processes
- ✅ **Simple Configuration** with maximum impact

**Orbix** is a comprehensive **VAT Refund & Payroll Payment Infrastructure** built on the Monad blockchain that eliminates traditional pain points through:
- **Monad blockchain** with EVM-compatible smart contracts for secure, instant transactions
- **MetaMask integration** for seamless user experience  
- **AI orchestration** (Google Gemini) for automated processing and validation
- **Supabase** for robust backend services and audit trails

---

## 🛑 Problem

- **Tourist VAT Refunds** are slow, manual, and often unclaimed due to airport delays.
- **Global Payroll** is plagued by high fees, delayed wires, hidden FX costs, and compliance overhead.
- Both processes rely on **centralized, fragmented rails** that fail in a borderless world.

---

## ✅ Solution

**Orbix** provides a **wallet-native payment infrastructure** where:
- Tourists **receive VAT refunds** instantly through MetaMask integration.
- Employers **manage payroll globally** with AI-assisted calculations and bulk transfers.
- Monad blockchain ensures **fast finality (~1s block time)** and **low transaction costs**.
- Smart contracts handle payment processing and audit trails automatically.

---

## ⚡ How It Works?

### 1. **Tourist VAT Refund Flow:**
- Retailer issues digital invoice + tax-free tag → Orbix locks a claim box on Monad
- Tourist departs → claim status flips to **VALIDATED**
- Protocol computes: `refund = VAT × rate – fee` (configurable: 85–87%)
- Executes instant payout in **MON** through MetaMask

### 2. **Payroll Flow:**  
- HR uploads payroll CSV → AI parses and applies jurisdiction-specific tax rules
- System snapshots FX rates and creates pay run ID anchored on-chain
- Funds disbursed through **chunked atomic transfers**
- Employees receive payments **instantly** with immutable audit trails

**Both modules share unified protocol treasury and compliance guardrails.**

---

## ⚡ Features

### **For Tourists (VAT Refunds)**
- 🚀 **Instant Refunds**: Add info → Scan QR → Confirm in MetaMask → Receive MON instantly
- ✈️ **No Missed Claims**: Avoid kiosk queues and paperwork bottlenecks entirely
- 💎 **Transparent Deductions**: Refund percentage and fees displayed in-wallet before confirmation  
- 🌍 **Cross-Border Utility**: Funds usable worldwide, not tied to local banking rails

### **For Employers (Payroll)**
- ⚡ **Bulk Payroll in Seconds**: Upload CSV → AI computes → One confirmation → Multiple employees paid
- 💰 **Low Fees, Instant Finality**: Monad transfers confirm in ~1s with minimal costs
- 🤖 **AI Compliance Layer**: Jurisdiction-aware salary parsing, deductions, and FX conversions

### **Unified Benefits**
- 📱 **Wallet-Native UX**: All approvals via MetaMask (confirm transactions)
- 📋 **Auditability**: Each refund/payrun anchored with metadata (`claim_id`, `payrun_id`)
- 🌐 **Global Reach**: Single infrastructure serving both tourists and enterprises
